# MovieTube 🎬
## Movie database website

Our comprehensive website allows users to search for a wide variety of movies. MovieTube provides a centralized platform where users can explore and access an extensive collection of films with just a few clicks. Upon logging in, users are directed to the “Home” page, designed by Wyatt Anderson, where they can navigate through the website using the Navbar. The “About Us” page, designed by Ariana Selzer, offers insights into the website’s purpose and introduces its creators. The “Genre” page, also designed by Wyatt Anderson, presents users with different movie genres, helping them discover films that match their interests. The “Search Results” page, created by Hunter Clark, displays relevant movies based on user queries. Our “Watchlist” page, designed by Wyatt Anderson, allows users to save and organize movies they wish to watch later. The “Contact” page, designed by Mabel Alagbe, provides a simple way for users to reach out with questions, suggestions, or issues. Finally, the “Reviews” page, created by Michaela, enables users to leave star ratings and written reviews for any movie available on the site. Open Movie Database (https://www.omdbapi.com/) was the API used to provide movie data and enrich the functionality of our platform. As the project is currently saved in github files, the user will have to run the program by accessing "CODE" and then accessing the separate pages via "download ZIP."
